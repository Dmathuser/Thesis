Thesis Project Created by David Mathews

# Goals:
- Create Simulation for Research.
	- Load Simulation from file
	- Data Arguments
		- Flags for picking algorithm type
		- \# of epochs
		- \# of time-steps in each epoch
		- Random Seed
		- File name for Simulation
		- Output File name?
- Code Algorithms (PIG, PIG++, Random Walk)
- Create Datafile.

# TODO:
## Step 1:
- Load Simulation from file
- Create Random Walk
- Output Data in usable format
- Create Python Script to graph Data

## Step 2:
- Work on PIG.
- Work on PIG++

## Step 3:
- Get Data Arguments Working.
- Parallel Process Simulations
- Create Multiple Simulation Files (For wider testing)

## Step 4:
- Data Gathering, Processing, and Graphing
